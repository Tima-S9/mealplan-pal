# MealPlan Pal

## Overview

MealPlan Pal is a full-featured Django web application designed to simplify meal planning, pantry management, and shopping list generation for individuals and families. The platform empowers users to organize their weekly meals, keep track of pantry inventory, and automatically generate shopping lists based on planned recipes and available ingredients.

**Key highlights include:**
- **Intuitive Dashboards:** Grouped navigation for Recipes, Pantry, Meal Plans, and Shopping, all styled with a modern Bootstrap 5 UI.
- **Recipe Management:** Create, edit, and delete your own recipes, or search for new ideas using an integrated external recipe API.
- **Smart Pantry Tracking:** Add, update, and remove pantry items, with suggestions for recipes you can make from what you have.
- **Meal Planning:** Build weekly meal plans by assigning recipes to days and meal types, with a visual calendar interface.
- **Automated Shopping Lists:** Instantly generate a shopping list for your meal plan, factoring in whatâ€™s already in your pantry to avoid duplicate purchases.
- **User Permissions:** Secure, user-specific dataâ€”each userâ€™s pantry, recipes, and plans are private and protected.
- **Robust Testing:** Comprehensive backend test suite ensures reliability, security, and correctness of all major features.

MealPlan Pal is ideal for anyone looking to save time, reduce food waste, and streamline their meal preparation processâ€”all in a user-friendly, mobile-responsive web app.

[User] 1---* [Recipe]
[User] 1---* [PantryItem] *---1 [Ingredient]
[User] 1---* [MealPlan] 1---* [MealPlanItem] *---1 [Recipe]
[Recipe] 1---* [RecipeIngredient] *---1 [Ingredient]
[MealPlan] 1---* [ShoppingItem] *---1 [Ingredient]
```

**Legend:**
- `1---*` means one-to-many
- `*---1` means many-to-one

**Description:**
- A User can have many Recipes, PantryItems, and MealPlans.
- Each Recipe can have many RecipeIngredients, each linking to an Ingredient.
- Each MealPlan can have many MealPlanItems (each for a day/meal), each linking to a Recipe.
- ShoppingItems are generated for each Ingredient needed for a MealPlan, factoring in PantryItems.

## Testing & Validation

MealPlan Pal includes a comprehensive backend test suite to ensure the reliability, security, and correctness of all major features. The tests are written using Djangoâ€™s built-in TestCase framework and cover CRUD operations, permissions, edge cases, and integration flows for all core app modules.
### How to run the tests:
1. **Install dependencies**
   Make sure you have all requirements installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the test suite**
   From the project root, run:
   ```bash
   python manage.py test
   ```
   This will automatically create a test database, run all tests, and display a summary of results.

### Test Coverage

The following features and scenarios are covered by the test suite:

#### Pantry Management
- **Create Pantry Item:** Verifies that a user can add a new pantry item with the correct ingredient and amount.
- **Edit Pantry Item:** Ensures a user can update the amount of an existing pantry item.
- **Delete Pantry Item:** Confirms a user can remove a pantry item from their list.

#### Recipe Management
- **Create Recipe:** Tests that a user can create a new recipe, including all required fields and form validation.
- **Edit Recipe:** Checks that a user can update recipe details.
- **Delete Recipe:** Ensures a user can delete a recipe they own.

#### Meal Plan Management
- **Create Meal Plan:** Validates that a user can create a meal plan for a specific week.

#### Shopping List Generation
- **Generate Shopping List:** Simulates the process of adding a recipeâ€™s ingredients to a shopping list for a selected meal plan, ensuring all related models (MealPlan, Recipe, RecipeIngredient, PantryItem, ShoppingItem) interact correctly.

#### Permissions and Security
- **Edit Other Userâ€™s Pantry Item (Forbidden):** Ensures users cannot edit pantry items belonging to other users.
- **Delete Other Userâ€™s Pantry Item (Forbidden):** Ensures users cannot delete pantry items belonging to other users.

### Test Results

All tests are currently passing:

| Test Class             | Test Method                              | Status |

| ShoppingListTest       | test_generate_shopping_list              | Passed |
| PermissionsTest        | test_edit_other_user_item_forbidden      | Passed |
| PermissionsTest        | test_delete_other_user_item_forbidden    | Passed |
| **Total: 10 tests, all passed.**                                 |

### Validation Approach

- **Isolated Test Database:** Tests run in a temporary database, ensuring no impact on production or development data.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Tests include edge cases such as permission violations and empty form submissions.
- **Debugging Support:** Tests were iteratively improved with debug output to ensure accurate diagnosis and validation of all backend logic.

### How to Add More Tests

To extend test coverage, add new test methods to `tests.py` following the structure of existing tests. Each test should:
- Set up the required data and user context.
- Perform the action (e.g., POST, GET).
- Assert the expected outcome using `self.assertEqual`, `self.assertTrue`, or `self.assertFalse`.

### Test Files Overview

- `tests.py` (Django): Unit/integration tests for models and views (located in your project root).
- `test_user_flows.spec.js`: Playwright end-to-end browser tests for key user flows.
- `TESTING_README.md`: A comprehensive list of all test files, their locations, and how they work.

## Known Issues & Limitations

- **Performance:** The app is optimized for small to medium-sized databases. Performance may vary with very large datasets.
- **API Limitations:** External recipe suggestions depend on the availability and rate limits of the integrated recipe API.
- **Email Functionality:** Email features require proper email backend configuration in `settings.py`.
